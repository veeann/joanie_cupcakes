How to Set-up Website Project:

1. Find a web host. Make sure the server supports MySQL and PHP.
2. PHP 5.3.28 or higher is recommended.
3. MySQL 5.6 or higher is recommended.
4. Set-up all the files related to the project, especially 'database.sql'.
5. Optionally, you can use 'populate.sql' in order to start the website with an Administrator account.
6. Administrator: username - 1; password - crazy.
7. You can edit all information later on. 
8. The main page of your website is in 'index.php'.


Notes on the website:

1. As a customer, ordering is the only thing you can actually do. You can also view the login page for employees.
2. A normal Employee and an Administrator have different permissions.
