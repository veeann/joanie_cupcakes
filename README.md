How to Set-up Project:

1. Make sure all files are in one folder (let us call it 'joanie' but you can name it anything).
2. All photos should be in a folder called 'images'.
3. This 'images' folder should be insider the 'joanie' folder.
4. Using mysql in the terminal/command line, source 'database.sql' to create the 'joanie' database and all needed tables.
5. Source the 'populate.sql' file in order to have sample data in the database.
6. Run the 'index.php' file in any browser.
7. Explore the website.

Notes on exploring the website:

1. As a customer, ordering is the only thing you can do. You can also view the login page for employees.
2. A normal Employee and an Administrator have different permissions. View both by using the sample accounts in the database.
     Administrator username - 1
     Administrator password - crazy 
     Employee username - 2
     Employee password - hello
